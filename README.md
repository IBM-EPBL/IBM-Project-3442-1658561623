A Novel Method for Handwritten Digit Recognition System
Handwriting recognition is one of the fascinating research projects currently underway because everyone in the world has their own writing style. It
is the computer's ability to automatically recognise handwritten digits or characters. Because of advances in science and technology, everything
is being digitalized to reduce human effort.
As a result, handwritten digit recognition is required in many real-time applications. The MNIST data set, which contains 70000 handwritten digits,is 
widely used in this recognition process. To train these images and create a deep learning model, we use artificial neural networks. A web application
is developed that allows the user to upload an image of a handwritten digit. The model analyses this image and returns the detected result to the user 
interface.
